I am a masters graduate in Computer Science from Quaid.i.Azam[QAU](http://cs.qau.edu.pk/), with vast experience in the fields of multimedia encryption and cryptography with Quantum Computing . I am skilled in development with MATLAB and Python. My reseach is focused on using **Quantum Computing** algorithms to make post quantum **Encryption Schemes**. I enjoy working in a growing and multicultural atmosphere since I am technical and rational.

A part from my research work, I help my fellow students in their Research and Teach them in my free time.
